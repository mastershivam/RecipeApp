# Recipe Archive TODO

## Now
- Add architectural diagram (system overview: client, Supabase, serverless endpoints).
- Add share notifications (email).
- Add per-file upload progress (real progress, not just animated bar).
- Add cache invalidation when cover photo changes.

## Next
- Recently cooked + Favorites sections on the home dashboard.
- Import/export (PDF/Markdown + common recipe formats).
- Recipe scaling (1x/2x/3x servings) with ingredient normalization.
- Cook Mode (step-by-step focus + timers).
- Server-side full-text search (Supabase tsvector).
- Tag autocomplete/suggestions.
- Paginated/infinite recipe list and gallery.
- Background upload queue with retries.
- Image optimization (resize/quality before upload).

## Done
- Server-side HEIC conversion via Vercel function.
- Upload progress indicator (indeterminate).
- Gallery image fitting fixes.
- Landing-style login page with global stats.
- App naming + logo update to Recipe Archive.
- Shared-with-you view with edit/view permissions.
- Signed URL caching to reduce refetching.
